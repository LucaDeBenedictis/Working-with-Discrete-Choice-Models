## Introduction

This R Markdown document contains the report on the use of the `mlogit` package and the formula-data interface (see <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlogit/vignettes> for the `mlogit` vignettes and <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Formula/vignettes/Formula.pdf> for the `Formula` vignette).


```{r , include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(mlogit)
library(Formula)
```

## Getting and inspecting the data


```{r , include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
data("Train", package="mlogit")

names(Train)
summary(Train)

Train$choiceid <- 1:nrow(Train)

head(Train, 3)




```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
